# File-Sharing

A file sharing website in which the user can upload files and provide a password to generate a link that can be sent to others. Accessing the link will initiate download of the file or ask for the password if the file is protected.

I created this project to strengthen and practice my backend development skills. I was able to see the server side perspective of clients uploading and downloading files. I had the opportunity to work on my front end development skills too, all the design and user interface is created entirely by me. 



## Tech Stack

**Server:** Node, Express, Pug

**Database:** Mongoose/MongoDB

**Template Engine:** Pug

**Other dependencies:** bcrypt, multer, dotenv



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/heyitsOK/file-sharing
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd file-sharing
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run all
```

The application should be running locally on port 3000 by default (Change port in .env). Go to localhost:3000 to test it.


## Demo

I made a video to demo the project and I published it as unlisted on youtube. Here is the link:
